## 1. Project Overview

This project creates a ficticious website for a ficticious tattoo parlour. It imagines the building to be in the heart of the coastal County of Galway. Where hundreds of years before Vikings themselves had their longboats beached. The site taps into this heritage and creates a celtic and norse based body art shop.

Valhalla Ink is a comprehensive website incorporating various technological elements to offer users a full understanding of Valhalla Ink. It is informative and showcases work done by the two in-house artists, Michael Lemmo and Sarah Crawford.

### Future Ideas

- Implement a 
## The 5 Planes of User Experience Development.

### Scope
For this project I have decided that it is best to keep it simple. A tattoo parlour does not need a fancy website.

I feel that the website needs:

- A header that can navigate between the differant pages and would be responsive on all devices.

- A home page that talks a little bit about the Shop and gives the user some history.

- An about the authors section where future customers can build up a familiarity with the clientele.

- A footer that has Social links and any contact information.

- A Gallery page so that the user can see some of the recent work done in the shop.

- A contact page so that future customers could express their designs in an in-house format on the site rather than emailing. 

### Structure 

My wireframes can be found below. The Website is setup so that it can be viewed on as many devices as possible. This was at the forefront of my design process. 

### Wireframes
The basic structure of Valhalla Ink was sketched out on paper and from there i made a wireframe for the home page and gallery, after some design issues I then made new wireframes which then came into fruition for the live website that is linked above. Plans changed during the initial stages. I have included the old and the redesigned Wireframes Below.

##### Old Wireframes

##### Final Wireframes


### Surface
The colors blue and a blueish grey were chosen because they were very common colours back in the era of the vikings. These were very easy to make dyes for.
